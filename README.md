Genetics and understanding the functional components of the human genome, proteins, epigenetic modifications etc. has immense potential for developing possible therapeutics and diagnostic methods for otherwise untreated conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Since most diseases and biological functions in the human body arise because of the complex interaction between hundreds of genes, the environment and its effect of gene expression and the billions of DNA bases pairs all of which are uniquely arranged, as we continue to map out human genomes data science is essential for extracting the desired genomic information from all this data.
Although there is a large scope for the possible applications of this field, the role primarily involves looking for insights into the data. One possible project would be to use genome data across a large sample space of individuals with and without a specific disease or disorder to identify DNA sequences, genes and/or proteins which are distinctly different between the two groups. This analysis could have applications in diagnostics of genetic conditions or intensifying genetics factors which contribute to diseases, it could also aid in drug discovery, target therapies, gene therapy, genome editing etc.
